# StayFocused (Kimojo)
Kimojo is an app that helps you stay productive by letting you block certain apps and silence notifications when you want to be productive. You can choose which apps you want to block by adding these apps to the Kimojo blacklist. Then, when you start a timer or alarm, Kimojo makes it harder to access the app, helping you resist the temptation.
